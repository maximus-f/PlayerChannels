# MySQL setup
# Note that it is not necessary to use MySQL to achieve bungeecord support. Synchronization can occur without a shared database and
# persist so long as you do not shut down all servers simultaneously (data is shared when servers come back from pre-existing servers in this way)
# but the better approach is to use a global database. Only MySQL is supported as of 3.8.
 # NOTE: Only global channels that are SAVED will be stored here. Local channels (one-server) are stored locally in chatrooms.yml
